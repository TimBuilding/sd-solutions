        Today, when i was walking back home from my job, i figured that i should
        build the best social media template in ThemeForest. As soon as i got
        back, i started working on this fresh and new project. Any suggestions
        about where i could find some interesting resources for social media
        design? #webdesign #socialmedia
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default PostContent
